IntroCompPhysics
================

A set of Jupyter notebooks that constitute an active-learning or self-directed
curriculum for UVM Physics 256: Computational Physics.

The main focus of this course will be to provide an introduction to modern
numerical techniques with the goal of either simulating or solving real
physical systems.  We will study examples from classical mechanics, electricity
and magnetism, chaos, quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics with an
emphasis on the graphical representation of results.  We will use
[Python](https://www.python.org/) as the main programming language with
libraries such as [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/),
[Scipy](https://scipy.org/) and [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) being employed
where appropriate.  A rough breakdown of topics includes:

- Introduction to the python language
- Errors and uncertainties in computation
- Finite difference methods (dissipation in classical mechanics, chaos, three-body problems
and Laplace's equation in electricity and magnetism) 
-  Quadrature (1d integration and Monte Carlo methods for higher dimensional integrals)
-  Interpolation, splines and Fourier Transforms (curve fitting and analysis of experimental or
simulation data) 
- Random systems (diffusion, percolation and fractals)
- Statistical mechanics (classical many body problem via Monte Carlo and
molecular dynamics)
- Linear algebra (quantum mechanics and spin systems)
